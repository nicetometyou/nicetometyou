                    The project aims to revitalize the ancient agricultural traditions of Romagna, linked to the work of the soil, the production of typical dishes and the creation of unique objects, such the rust print on hemp fabric. 
                    The focus of the project will be on this tradition, now cultivated only by a few artisans, who hand down a tradition now at the end in their small shops, located between Forlì, Cesena, Santarcangelo and Rimini.
                    Starting from MET - Museo Etnografico degli Usi e Costumi della Gente di Romagna (Ethnographic Museum of the Uses and Customs of the People of Romagna), located in Santarcangelo di Romagna (Rimini), I have conducted a study on the strengths of the museum and the weaknesses that should be reviewed to encourage a revival of the museum and give it new vigor, thus allowing a museum rich in history to enter the center of the community of Romagna. The museum is temporarily closed for maintenance work on the building, but is still active with events in the outdoor park dedicated to children and families.</p>

                <p class="sub-description2">As stated in the Text of the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, rust          print falls within the category E (traditional craftsmanship) of the second point of article no. 2. <br/>
                    The origin of the rust print can be traces back to poor craftsmanship: wooden molds, colors obtained from rust, fabric made from hemp. Unfortunately, there are numerous difficulties in genealogical reconstruction of rust printing and a lack of scientific studies around this unique expression of material culture. The oldest documents on Romagna's canvases date back to the first decades of the 19th century. <br/>
                    Printing on fabric was the embroidery of the poor who had designs printed on the tablecloth and especially on the blankets of the oxen. The fortune of this type of handicraft derives precisely from the requests of the poor people who led to elaborate different ornaments.<br/>
                    The modest cultural role and the type of market can justify the silence of official sources on this art, whose memory is mainly entrusted to the oral tradition. <br/>
                    For these reasons, it is necessary to find digital and other tools that can safeguard the tradition, making it known to young people, and trying to pass on and save an art that is almost disappearing.</p>

                <p>The Ethnographic Museum of the Uses and Customs of the People of Romagna is located in Santarcangelo di Romagna, in the hinterland of Rimini. It was inaugurated in 1981 thanks to the work of collecting material from Romagna started in the 60s by the "Ethnographic Committee", originally only a group of volunteers, led by Giuseppe Sebesta. </br>
                  The Ethnographic Centre for Research and Documentation was opened in 1985, and the research and documentary production campaigns were launched and systematically organised. With this centre, the museum provides itself with archives and instruments for scientific dissemination, setting up research laboratories to promote the study of popular traditions, the production of audiovisual documentation, texts, periodical exhibitions, conferences, study days and educational initiatives. The centre has a library specialising in demo-ethno-anthropology and important archives of audiovisual, photographic and iconographic sources.</p>
