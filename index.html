          </br>
            <li><span class="list">Identification and definition of the element:</span> The article 2 of the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage state that “The intangible cultural heritage means the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognize as part of their cultural heritage”. </br>
              Today rust printing on fabric is an art practiced only by very few artisans and its social role is minimal compared to what it once had. Nowadays many people do not know this type of craft, or have vaguely heard of it. It is also important to mention that the production of rust prints suffered the damage of industrialization. In fact, there are souvenir shops, especially on the Romagna Riviera, which sell non-original prints, industrially produced, which obviously damage the great work of craftsmanship of local artisans. </br>
              What characterizes every printer is the attention to detail and the extraordinary ability to print the fabric, each different from the other, through a knowledge that is handed down from father to son, jealously guarded in the shops. In fact, every printer has a very personal recipe for the creation of colors and a particular wood-carving technique for molds. </br>
              Today, the only system of transmission of rust printing is thanks to the work of the MET which organized, before the closure for renewal in September 2017, educational workshops designed ad hoc for kindergarten, elementary school, middle school and high school.

                                    I have chosen to focus on <a href="rustprint.html">rust prints</a>: decorations on hemp fabrics, cultivated and harvested in the Romagna countryside. Rust printing is a tradition that is lost in time, so much so that it is difficult to find a starting date. In fact, this art was born among poor people who found a way to decorate their household linen with an equally humble tool, rust. </br>
                                    My interest in this kind of art stems from the fact that not many people today know this type of printing process, and outside the area of Romagna is completely unknown. Today there are very few artisans who still cultivate the tradition of rust printing in small and old shops,where they follow the printing process as it happened hundreds of years ago. The oldest shops still have huge wooden wheels driven by the force of man, which were used (and still are) to activate a mechanism for stretching the fabrics. </br>
                                    The development of the idea for the preservation of this heritage was not at all simple: the lack of sources, the silence of the craftsmen not to reveal any secrets, the closure of the only museum that preserves part of this tradition have made it even more difficult to understand how to pass on the tradition and give rise to interest in this type of craftsmanship in the younger generations. </br>
                                    In the end, the choice was to develop various multimedia applications at the <a href="http://www.museisantarcangelo.it/met/" target="_blank">MET</a> (Museo Etnografico degli Usi e Costumi della Gente di Romagna) for primary and secondary school children. But not only multimedia innovation: I have chosen to emphasize the rediscovery of the pleasure of manual craftsmanship with sensory and emotional paths to stimulate the active participation of users, allowing them to touch copies of the original tools of the fabric printer from Romagna.</p>
