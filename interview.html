<p>Unfortunately the MET is closed since September 2017 for building maintenance reasons. I couldn't interview the museum's users, but I did a long interview with the head of educational services at the MET, Mrs. Federica Foschi. 
</br> I also had the opportunity to visit the room that housed the museum to better understand how the museum was organized; you will find the report of the visit. The renovation of the museum is expected to start soon.
</p>

  Note: </br>
  MP= Michela Parma </br>
  FF= Federica Foschi

<p>FF: Events and projects related to the museum: </br>

  <li>PAM CLUB Little friends of the museums of Santarcangelo (2019: 20 years of Pam club): every year we propose a project with meetings, workshops, shows, readings for children aged 3 to 10 years and their families (in each appointment there are 20/30 people between adults and children);</li>

<div class="mainbody-interview">
<p style="color: #cc5200">Question no. 5</p>
<p> MP: Did the museum itinerary involve the active participation of the user? Was it possible to handle or try to use traditional Romagna tools? </p>
<p>FF: No, the museum tour did not include the active participation of the users. It often happened that visitors, especially children, touch the instruments and tools, because they are attractive, but there was no tactile path. </p>

<div class="mainbody-interview">
<p style="color: #cc5200">Question no. 7</p>
<p> MP: What are the strengths of the museum that attract visitors?</p>
<p>FF: The strengths are the objects themselves, which relate to the history, traditions and culture of the southern Romagna region, so the knowledge and discovery of the use of these tools fascinates a lot, in particular the immaterial aspect, that is the whole rituality, gestures, symbolism linked to these objects and to everyday life, work, social and family life.</p>

<div class="mainbody-interview">
<p style="color: #cc5200">Question no. 8</p>

    <p> MP: What kind of documents are kept in the museum's archives and library? Have they been digitised?</p>
    <p>FF: All books that were kept in the museum library were transferred to the municipal library A. Baldini. We have numerous documents which have not been digitised but which can be consulted, upon request, by students and researchers. For the photographic funds we had started a digitisation project which unfortunately came to a halt about 3 years ago due to force majeure. 
    Finally, the documents in the video library have been converted from VHS to DVD and those in the audio library have been converted from cassettes to CDs.</p>
